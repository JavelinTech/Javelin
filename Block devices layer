In include/javelin/block.h:
    Every block device has its own entry in blockDevices array.
    Element of this array are BlockDevice structure's instances and every element describes one block device (device request function and request object).
    Every process can communicate with a block device using the buffer in host's memory.
    Request management structure deviceRequests[32] is a data structure for reading and writing, which is a bridge between buffer block in the Javelin's buffer and logical block in a block device.
    Requests are in queue.

    Read operations always go before write operations.
