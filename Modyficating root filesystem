If you want to modyficate content of Javelin's root filesystem for f.e. add some files/programs to it do the following:

Mount the rootfs image as loopback device:
sudo kpartx -a javelinRootFS.img

Mount the loopback device to some directories (there are 2 partitions):
    At first partition (64 MB) there is Javelin's native rootfs.
    At second partition (64 MB) there is empty partition.
mkdir someDir1
mkdir someDir2
sudo mount /dev/mapper/someLoopback1 someDir1
sudo mount /dev/mapper/someLoopback2 someDir2

Now modificate the file system by modyficating the directories: someDir1, someDir2.

Now you must umount previously mounted Javelin's rootfs and loopback device:
sudo umount /dev/mapper/someLoopback1
sudo umount /dev/mapper/someLoopback2
sudo kpartx -d javelinRootFS.img

Now you have properly modyficated rootfs.
